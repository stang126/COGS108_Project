By identifying the obesity rates and average income for each city in the US, can we determine an index for the correlation strength between income and obesity within each city? Can we then create a ranking system to compare the indices across cities and states? Is there a geographic trend for the intensity of income/obesity correlation across the United States?"

Specifically, for each city, it contains the city name and FIPS code, its population count from 2010, and a state abbreviation. Additionally, it also contains a model-based estimate for the crude and age adjusted prevalence of certain health conditions and its 95% confidence interval for adults older than 18 years old; it has statistics for conditions such as those without health insurance, arthritis, binge drinking, high blood pressure and those who are taking medicine to treat it, cancer (excluding skin cancer), lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, etc. For the purpose of this project, we will mainly be using the state abbreviation, city name, and age adjusted prevalence for obesity. \n",

Additionally, if the zipcode is a Zip Code Tabulation area (ZCTA), it will contain information about its ZCTA, population, density. The database also contains information if the latitude and longitude was geolocated using the city name and if the zipcode is used by the US military. For the purpose of this project, we will mainly be using the state, city name, and zipcode information. "
